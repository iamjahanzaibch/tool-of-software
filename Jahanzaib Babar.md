> "Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"



> Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...

> His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.
>

<!-- Paragraphs -->
We pictured the meek mild creatures where

They dwelt in their strawy pen,

Nor did it occur to one of us there

To doubt they were kneeling then.

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.

 Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way, that you don't make a mess.

 If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.

 Basically, take the same guidance as above, don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!
